# Manage Scripts

Use the dashboard to control all scripts.

## Script list

You can:

- Enable or disable scripts
- Search by name
- Filter by website, status, and run timing
- Edit or delete scripts

## Settings tab

Main settings include:

- Enable scripts by default
- Show notifications
- Enhanced debugging
- Allow external resources
- Confirm first run

## Best practices

- Keep unused scripts disabled.
- Review scripts with broad `@match` rules.
- Keep `allow external resources` off unless needed.
