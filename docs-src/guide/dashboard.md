# Manage Scripts

Use the dashboard to control scripts and global settings.

## Script list actions

- Enable or disable scripts.
- Search by script name.
- Filter by status and run timing.
- Open script in editor.
- Delete script.

## Settings that matter

- `Enable scripts by default`
- `Show notifications`
- `Enhanced debugging`
- `Allow external resources`
- `Confirm first run`

## Safe defaults

- Keep `Allow external resources` off unless needed.
- Keep URL scope tight in `@match`.
- Disable scripts you are not using.
