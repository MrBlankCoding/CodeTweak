# Install From Greasy Fork

CodeTweak supports Greasy Fork in two ways.

## From dashboard

1. Open dashboard.
2. Click `Browse Scripts`.
3. Search by script name or keyword.
4. Click `Import`.
5. Review code in editor and save.

## From greasyfork.org

CodeTweak can intercept `.user.js` install links and open them in CodeTweak.

## After import

Always review:

- `@match` rules
- `@grant` usage
- external `@require` URLs
- network requests in code

If the script is too broad, edit it before enabling.
