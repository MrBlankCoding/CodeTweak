# CodeTweak

**CodeTweak** is a modern user script manager and JavaScript editor, designed as a modern alternative to Tampermonkey. It is fully open source and built with privacy in mind.

---

## Description

CodeTweak provides full support for **Manifest V3**, offering a modern code editor with linting, formatting, basic autocomplete, and syntax highlighting. It supports all safe GM APIs and URL matching. Users can install scripts directly from **Greasy Fork** and manage them via the dashboard.

We prioritize privacy: **no tracking, no analytics, no selling of user data**. All permissions are only requested for GM API support.
