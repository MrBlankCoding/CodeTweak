# CodeTweak

**CodeTweak** is a modern user script manager and JS editor designed as a modern alternative to Tampermonkey.

---

## Description
CodeTweak is fully open source and provides support for manifest v3. The code editor offers features like linting, formatting, basic autocomplete, and syntax highlighting. CodeTweak supports all the safe GM APIs, and url matching. Users can also install scripts directly from Greasy Fork and manage them on the dashboard. The extension is also privacy focused and we do not track, collect or sell user data. All permissions are implemented for GM API support.
